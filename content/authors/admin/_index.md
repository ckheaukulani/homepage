I am a machine learning specialist within Singapore's Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation, working on system-level healthcare innovation. My work contributes to several health-tech and population health initiatives and I am active in the basic machine learning research community.

From a machine learning perspective: My work usually favors methods from Bayesian inference and deep learning. Recent general themes include the modeling of highly-structured time series and relational networks, analyzing clinical trial and electronic health record data, and modeling the behavior of individuals with data from multiple sensors.

From a healthcare perspective: I am a part of the Ministry for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT) where I work with the technologist Robert JT Morris and Singapore's Chief Health Scientist Chor Chuan Tan. We run programs, partner on clinical trials, and develop digital health tools, among other interventions. My current efforts revolve around mental health, chronic diseases, and the deployment of digital health solutions like digital phenotyping.


### Working and collaborating with us

We seek interns, graduate students, and full-time hires across a range of needs. Those that would be working with me include data scientists and public health 

We have close, vibrant partnerships with several institutions across Singapore and beyond including the Institute of Mental Health, the Health Promotion Board, clinicians and researchers across health clusters and Universities, tech companies, and start-ups. 

### About

I completed my PhD in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). My fellowship was awarded by the Cambridge Trusts and Queens' College. During my PhD, I undertook a few internships and consulted, and I subsequently worked as a Vice President & Executive Director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, where I helped to develop a machine learning team in the Securities division.
