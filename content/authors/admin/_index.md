I am a Senior Assistant Director and a Senior AI & Data Scientist at the Ministry of Health in Singapore, working on system-level healthcare interventions.

Previously, I was a Vice President & Executive Director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, where I helped to establish a machine learning team in the Securities division.

I completed my PhD in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). I was previously supervised by [Andrew R. Barron](http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/) and [Sekhar Tatikonda](http://pantheon.yale.edu/~sct29/) in the Statistics Department at Yale University.
