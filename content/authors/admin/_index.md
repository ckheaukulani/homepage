I am a Senior AI & Data Scientist in Singapore's Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation, working on system-level healthcare innovation. I am a machine learning scientist and engineer by training, and my current work contributes to several health-tech and population health initiatives. I am also active in the basic machine learning research community.

From a machine learning perspective: My work usually favors methods from Bayesian inference and deep learning. Recent general themes include the modeling of highly-structured time series and relational networks, analyzing clinical trial and electronic health record data, and modeling the behavior of individuals with data from multiple sensors.

From a healthcare perspective: We run population health programs, partner on clinical trials, and develop digital health platforms, among other initiatives. My current efforts revolve around mental health, chronic diseases, and the deployment of digital health solutions like digital phenotyping.

### Working with our team

Our Data, Science, & Technology team seeks interns, graduate students, and full-time hires across a range of needs. Those that would work directly with me include data scientists as well as those focused on the design and evaluation of population health programs that use innovative technologies. Please see below for more details.

### About

I completed my PhD in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). My work around that time focused on Bayesian nonparametrics, network modeling, Bayesian deep learning, MCMC, and variational inference. During my PhD, I did a few internships and consulted for companies, and more recently I was as a Vice President & Executive Director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, where I helped to develop a machine learning team in the Securities division.
