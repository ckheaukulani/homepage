I am a Senior AI & Data Scientist in Singapore's Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation, working on system-level healthcare innovation. My work contributes to several health-tech and population health initiatives and I am active in the basic machine learning research community.

From a machine learning perspective: My work usually favors methods from Bayesian inference and deep learning. Recent general themes include the modeling of highly-structured time series and relational networks, analyzing clinical trial and electronic health record data, and modeling the behavior of individuals with data from multiple sensors.

From a healthcare perspective: We run population health programs, partner on clinical trials, and develop digital health platforms, among other interventions. My current efforts revolve around mental health, chronic diseases, and the deployment of digital health solutions like digital phenotyping.

### Working with our team

Our Data, Science, & Technology team seeks interns, graduate students, and full-time hires across a range of needs. I am personally interested in recruiting/working with data scientists and those focused on the design and evaluation of population health programs that use innovative technologies. I also aim to develop collaborations with machine learning researchers. Please see below for more details.

### About

I completed my PhD in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/). My fellowship was awarded by the Cambridge Trusts and Queens' College. During my PhD, I undertook a few internships and consulted, and I subsequently worked as a Vice President & Executive Director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, where I helped to develop a machine learning team in the Securities division.
