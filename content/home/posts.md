### Work or collaborate with us

We are looking for interns and graduate students to work with us. Those that would be working with me include data scientists and machine learning researchers. Internships can last from three months to one year, and can start at any point throughout the year. I am particularly keen to work long-term with PhD students in machine learning with methodological interests similar to mine. Such collaborations could take the form of repeated summer internships and/or collaborations throughout your degree. Masters students and final year undergraduates with strong training in data science would also be welcome for internships. We also find regular need for students from a public health background (particularly those working in the design and analysis of population health programs, digital health, mental health, and health economics), though interest and at least some training in data analysis would likely be necessary. 

If interested, please feel free to email me with your CV.

We have close, vibrant partnerships with several institutions across Singapore and beyond including the Institute of Mental Health, the Health Promotion Board, clinicians and researchers across health clusters and Universities, tech companies, and start-ups.
